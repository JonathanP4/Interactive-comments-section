### Side Notes

#### About the screen size

Currently this app only looks good on devices with a screen width < 541px

#### Concerns

My biggest concern is in regard to the performance of this app. The way I implemented some of the functionality might be too performance intensive, plus, the amount of components might result in VERY long loading times for slower internet connections.<br/>
With that said though at my current knowledge level of React I don't think I'm able to improve it much when it comes to that. Maybe in a few weeks/months I'll come back to it and laugh at my own mistakes and fix this code.
